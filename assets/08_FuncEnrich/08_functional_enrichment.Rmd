## Why enrichment analysis?  {.larger}

- Human genome contains ~20,000-25,000 genes
- Each gene has multiple functions
- If 1,000 genes have changed in an experimental condition, it may be difficult to understand what they do

## Annotation databases and ontologies

- An annotation database annotates genes with functions or properties - sets of genes with shared functions
- Structured prior knowledge about genes

<center>
![](img/GO_db.png)
</center>

## Gene ontology {.larger}

- An ontology is a formal (hierarchical) representation of concepts and the relationships between them.

- The objective of GO is to provide controlled vocabularies of terms for the description of gene products.

- These terms are to be used as attributes of gene products, facilitating uniform queries across them.

## Gene ontology hierarchy {.larger}

- Terms are related within a hierarchy using "is-a", "part-of" and other connectors

<center>
![](img/GO_1.png)
</center>

## Gene ontology structure {.larger}

Gene ontology describes multiple levels of detail of gene function.

- **Molecular Function** - the tasks performed by individual gene products; examples are _transcription factor_ and _DNA helicase_ 

>- **Biological Process** - broad biological goals, such as _mitosis_ or _purine metabolism_, that are accomplished by ordered assemblies of molecular functions 

>- **Cellular Component** - subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular complexes; examples include _nucleus_, _telomere_, and _origin recognition complex_

## Enrichment analysis | Null hypothesis {.larger}

- **Self-contained $H_0$**: genes in the gene set do not have any association with the pheontype

- Problem: restrictive, use information only from a gene set
                  
<center>
![](img/self_vs_competitive.png)
</center>

## Enrichment analysis | Null hypothesis {.larger}

- **Competitive $H_0$**: genes in the gene set have the same level of association with a given phenotype as genes in the complement gene set

- Problem: wrong assumption of independent gene sampling

<center>
![](img/self_vs_competitive.png)
</center>

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Overrepresentation analysis, Hypergeometric test** 

- $m$ is the total number of genes
- $j$ is the number of genes are in the functional category
- $n$ is the number of differentially expressed genes
- $k$ is the number of differentially expressed genes in the category

<center><img src="img/hypergeometric.png" height="220px" /></center>

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Overrepresentation analysis, Hypergeometric test** 

- $m$ is the total number of genes
- $j$ is the number of genes are in the functional category
- $n$ is the number of differentially expressed genes
- $k$ is the number of differentially expressed genes in the category

The expected value of $k$ would be $k_e=(n/m)*j$. 

If $k > k_e$, functional category is said to be enriched, with a ratio of enrichment $r=k/k_e$

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Overrepresentation analysis, Hypergeometric test** 

- $m$ is the total number of genes
- $j$ is the number of genes are in the functional category
- $n$ is the number of differentially expressed genes
- $k$ is the number of differentially expressed genes in the category

|                    | Diff. exp. genes | Not Diff. exp. genes | Total |
|--------------------|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:------|
| In gene set        |        k         |           j-k        | j     |
| Not in gene set    |       n-k        |         m-n-j+k      | m-j   |
| Total              |       n          |           m-n        |  m    |

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Overrepresentation analysis, Hypergeometric test** 

- $m$ is the total number of genes
- $j$ is the number of genes are in the functional category
- $n$ is the number of differentially expressed genes
- $k$ is the number of differentially expressed genes in the category

What is the probability of having $k$ or more genes from the category in the selected $n$ genes?

$$P = \sum_{i=k}^n{\frac{\binom{m-j}{n-i}\binom{j}{i}}{{m \choose n}}}$$

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Overrepresentation analysis, Hypergeometric test** 

- $m$ is the total number of genes
- $j$ is the number of genes are in the functional category
- $n$ is the number of differentially expressed genes
- $k$ is the number of differentially expressed genes in the category

$k < (n/m)*j$ - underrepresentation. Probability of $k$ or less genes from the category in the selected $n$ genes?

$$P = \sum_{i=0}^k{\frac{\binom{m-j}{n-i}\binom{j}{i}}{{m \choose n}}}$$

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Overrepresentation analysis (ORA)**

1. Find a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
2. Are _DEGs in a set_ more common than _DEGs not in a set_?

- Fisher test `stats::fisher.test()`
- Conditional hypergeometric test, to account for directed hierachy of GO `GOstats::hyperGTest()`

&nbsp;

Example: https://github.com/mdozmorov/MDmisc/blob/master/R/gene_enrichment.R

## Approach 1 {.larger}

**Problems with Fisher's exact test**

- The outcome of the overrepresentation test depends on the significance threshold used to declare genes differentially expressed. 

- Functional categories in which many genes exhibit small changes may go undetected. 

- Genes are not independent, so a key assumption of the Fisher’s exact tests is violated.

- Pathways overlap

## Approach 2

**Functional Class Scoring (FCS)**

- **Gene set analysis (GSA)**. Mootha et al., 2003; modified by Subramanian, et al. "**Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.**" PNAS 2005 http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545.abstract

- Main rationale – functionally related genes often display a coordinated expression to accomplish their roles in the cells

- Aims to identify gene sets with "subtle but coordinated"  expression changes that would be missed by DEGs threshold selection

## GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis {.larger}

- The null hypothesis is that the **rank ordering** of the genes in a given comparison is **random** with regard to the case-control assignment.

>- The alternative hypothesis is that the **rank ordering** of genes sharing functional/pathway membership is **associated** with the case-control assignment.

## GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis

1. Sort genes by log fold change
2. Calculate running sum - increment when gene in a set, decrement when not
3. Maximum of the runnig sum is the enrichment score - larger means genes in a set are toward top of the sorted list
4. Permute subject labels to calculate significance p-value

<center>
![](img/gsea.png)
</center>

## GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis

- Compute a statistic (difference between 2 clinical groups) for each gene that measures the degree of differential expression between treatments. 
- Create a list $L$ of all genes ordered according to these statistics. 
- Given a set of genes $S$ we can see if these genes are non-randomly distributed in our list $L$ 
- If the experiment produced random results, we don’t expect gene order to have biological coherence 

## GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis

- Calculate an enrichment score ($ES$) that reflects the degree to which a set $S$ is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list $L$. 
- The score is calculated by walking down the list $L$ and ... 
    - Increase a running-sum statistic when we encounter a gene in $S$
    - Decrease it when we encounter genes not in $S$. 

- The magnitude of the increment depends on the correlation of the gene with the phenotype.
- The final enrichment score is the maximum deviation from zero encountered in the random walk 
    - Corresponds to a weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov-like statistics

## GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis

**Enrichment Score**

- Consider genes $R_1, ..., R_N$ ordered by the difference metric
- Consider a gene set $S$ of size $G$, containing functionally similar genes or pathway members.
- If $R_i$ is not a member of $S$, define

$$X_{Ri}=-\sqrt{\frac{G}{N-G}}$$

- If $R_i$ is a member of $S$, define

$$X_{Ri}=\sqrt{\frac{N-G}{G}}$$

## GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis

**Enrichment Score**

- Compute running sum across all $N$ genes. The $ES$ is defined as 

$$\max_{1 \le j \le N} \sum_{i=1}^j{X_{Ri}}$$

- or the maximum observed positive deviation of the running sum. 
- $ES$ is measured for every gene set considered. To determine whether any of the given gene sets shows association with the class phenotype distinction, permute the class labels 1,000 times, each time recording the maximum $ES$ over all gene sets.

## Other approaches {.larger}

**Linear model-based**

- **CAMERA** (Wu and Smyth 2012)
- **C**orrelation-**A**djusted **ME**an **RA**nk gene set test
- Estimating the variance inflation factor associated with inter-gene correlation, and incorporating this into parametric or rank-based test procedures

## Other approaches {.larger}

**Linear model-based**

- **ROAST** (Wu et.al. 2010)
- Under the null hypothesis (and assuming a linear model) the residuals are independent and identically distributed $N(0,\sigma_g^2)$.
- We can _rotate_ the residual vector for each gene in a gene set, such that gene-gene expression correlations are preserved.
