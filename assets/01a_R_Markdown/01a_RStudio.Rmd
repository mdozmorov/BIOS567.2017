## RStudio

### What is it?

* RStudio is a program that allows you to run R in a more user-friendly environment
    * RStudio offers some GUI (graphical user interface) features for R
* RStudio can be considered a "portal"
    * The same R program is running underneath the interface
* RStudio is open-source software (and therefore is free)
    * Available for download at: http://rstudio.com

<img src="img/RStudioConsole8.png" width="800" style="float:center" />

## Getting help

- Is there a built-in function that does x? and if so,
- Where can i find it among the +2000 R Packages in CRAN?

- Use `?function_name` to get help on a function from a _loaded_ package
- Use `??function_name` to search for the function across all installed packages, even not loaded
- Use `apropos("part_of_function_name")` if you forgot the exact name, to get suggestions what the function name may be
- `library(sos)`, `findFn` function, e.g., findFn("cosine", maxPages=2, sortby="MaxScore")
- Search engine is your best friend on many things
