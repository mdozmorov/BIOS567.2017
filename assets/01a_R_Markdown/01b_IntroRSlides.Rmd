## Intro to R

Demonstrate the following in `R`:

- read in and manipulate tabular data
- basic statistics
- graphing

This tutorial assumes you're brand new to `R`. The goal is to learn getting the data into `R` and do basic analysis.

## A little about `R`

- A statistical computing environment with its own language
- Released in 2000; an open source implementation of `S`
- Highly regarded for its statistical and graphical facilities
- Maintained by volunteers
- https://www.r-project.org/
- Easy interface with RStudio

## An Updated History of R

1992: R development begins as a research project in Auckland, NZ by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka 
1993: First binary versions of R published at Statlib [see update, below]
1995: R first distributed as open-source software, under GPL2 license
1997: R core group formed
1997: CRAN founded (by Kurt Jornik and Fritz Leisch)
1999: The R website, r-project.org, founded
1999: First in-person meeting of R Core team, at inaugural Directions in Statistical Computing conference, Vienna
2000: R 1.0.0 released (February 29) 
2000: John Chambers, recipient of the 1998 ACM Software Systems Award for the S language, joins R Core
2001: R News founded (later to become the R Journal)
2003: R Foundation founded
2004: First UseR! conference (in Vienna)
2004: R 2.0.0 released
2009: First edition of the R Journal
2013: R 3.0.0 released
2015: R Consortium founded, with R Foundation participation
2016: New R logo adopted

## `R` basics - functions

* `R` uses *functions* to do things.

* Functions take *arguments* to specify how, or to what, to do those things. 

* Example:

    + `read.csv(file="scores.csv")` 

* `read.csv` is a function to import a CSV file and `file` is an argument that specifies which file to import.


## `R` basics - running functions

An `R` script is a text file that contains all your `R` code. `R` scripts allow you to save, edit, reproduce and share your code.

Two common ways to run code:

1. From the command line; type the function and hit Enter
2. In an `R` script; type the name of an R script, hit Enter to execute all code in the script


## `R` basics - assignment

* We often need to save a function's result or output. For this we use the assignment operator: ` <- `  

* For example, when you import a CSV file you need to give it a name: 

`scores <- read.csv(file="scores.csv")`   
 
* Now we can use `scores` as an argument to other functions. For example, compute summary statistics for each column in the data:

`summary(scores)` 

* **Note**: Use `Alt + -` (Win) or `Option + -` (Mac) in RStudio to quickly insert ` <- `. You can also use `=` for assignment.


## `R` basics - packages

- All functions belong to *packages*. The `read.csv` function is in the `utils` package.

- `R` comes with about 30 packages (called "base `R`"), but as of January 2017 there are close to 10,000 user-contributed packages! 

- Example: `ggplot2` is a popular package that adds functions for creating graphs in a different way than what base `R` provides

- To use functions in a package, the package must be installed and loaded. (They're free)

- You only _install_ a package once. 

- You _load_ a package whenever you want to use its functions. 

## Useful ways of getting data into R

- For delimiter-separated files, use `readr` package, <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/README.html>
- For reading/writing Excel files, use `openxlsx` package, <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/index.html>. Alternatively, `readxl` by Hadley Wickham for Excel reading only, <https://github.com/tidyverse/readxl>
- For reading data from Clipboard, use `psych::read.clipboard.tab` or 
- For fixed-width files, use `read.fwf` or `readr::read_fwf` funcitons
