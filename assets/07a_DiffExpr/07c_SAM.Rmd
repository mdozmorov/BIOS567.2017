## Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) {.larger}

- V. G. Tusher et.al. "Significance Analysis of Microarrays Applied to the Ionizing Radiation Response" PNAS 2001 http://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/5116.long

- A clever adaptation of the t-ratio to borrow information across genes 

- SAM seeks to control the proportion of false rejections among the set of rejected hypotheses (FDR). 

- Permutation method is used to calculate the null distribution of the modified t-statistics.

## SAM procedure

## SAM t-test

- With small sample sizes low and high variance can occur by chance
-  Variance depends on expression level
- Try to remove (or minimize) the dependence of test statistics on variances (because small variance tend to lead to bigger test statistics).
- Solution: add a small constant to the denominator in calculating t statistics:  

$$d_i = \frac{\bar{y_i} − \bar{x_i}}{s_i +s_0}$$  

- $\bar{y_i}, \bar{x_i}$ - Means of two groups for gene i.  
- $s_i$ - Standard deviation for gene i, assuming equal variance in both groups.   
- $s_0$ - "Exchangeability factor" estimated using all genes.  


## SAM two-class unpaired

- For each gene, compute the d-value (similar to a t-statistic). This is the observed d-value ($d_i$) for that gene. 
- Randomly shuffle the expression values between groups A and B. Compute the d-value for each randomized set. 
- Take the average of the randomized d-values for each gene. This is the ‘expected relative difference’ ($d_E$) of that gene. Difference between ($d_i$) and ($d_E$) is used to measure significance.   
- Plot $d_{(i)}$ vs. $d_{E(i)}$
- Calculate FDR = average number of genes that exceed $\Delta$ in the permuted data.

## Why $s_0$ ("fudge" factor)? {.larger}

- Prevents $d_{(i)}$ from becoming too large when the variance is close to zero (which can lead to false positives)

- Choose one $s_0$ for the entire dataset, to make the coefficient of variation of $d_{(i)}$ approximately constant

- Typically, $s_0$ can be computed as the $90^{th}$ percentile of the standard errors of all genes

## Estimating significance {.larger}

- We have calculated a new statistics and we don’t have a parametric description of the null distribution 

- Solution: generate an empirical null distribution form a set of experiments where all hypotheses should be null 

- Generate permutations of data labels so no difference is expected 

- For each permutation $p$, calculate $d_{p(i)}$.

## Identifying Significant Genes {.larger}

- Define a threshold $\Delta$
- Find the smallest positive $d_{(i)}$ such that

$$|d_{(i)} - d_{E(i)}| \ge \Delta$$

- Call it $t_1$
- In a similar manner, find the largest negative $d_{(i)}$. Call it $t_2$
- For each gene $i$, if $d_{(i)} \ge t_1 \lor d_{(i)} \le t_2$, call it potentially significant

## Identifying Significant Genes {.larger}

- Rank the original d(i)’s: $d_{(1)} \ge d_{(2)} \ge d_{(3)} \ge ...$
- Plot $d_{(i)}$ vs. $d_{E(i)}$
- For most of the genes, $d_{(i)} \sim d_{E(i)}$

## Estimate FDR {.larger}

- $t_1$ and $t_2$ will be used as cutoffs
- Calculate the average number of genes that exceed these values in the permutations.
- Estimate the number of falsely significant genes, under $H_0$:
$$\frac{1}{n.perm}\sum_{p=1}^{n.perm}{number \{ d_{p(i)} \ge t_1 \lor d_{p(i)} \le t_2 \} }$$
- Divide by the number of genes called significant

Delta $\Delta$ is the half-width of the bar around the 45-degree line

## Other applications of SAM {.larger}

- More than two groups
- Paired data
- Survival data, with censored response 

## SAM summary {.larger}

- Highly cited (>7000 citations), http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/.
- Implemented as Bioconductor package `siggenes`, and Excel plugin.
- Follow-up work: SAMSeq on RNA-seq DE test.
- Limitations: solutions for $s_0$ often sensitive to data.

## Summary on two-sample DE test {.larger}

- Try to alleviate the “small sample variance” problem.
- Combine information from all genes.
- Many other variations of the model.
- In practice SAM and limma performs similarly.
